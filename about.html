            <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
            <p>My name is Luis Caban, and I am an active-duty military service member with a strong passion for fitness and technology. Over the years, I’ve developed an interest in structured workouts, discipline, and how technology can enhance the way people train. This led me to create FitLife Pro as part of this course project.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Why FitLife Pro?</h2>
            <p>When thinking about a project for this class, fitness was the most natural topic for me. I spend a lot of time training, learning about exercise programming, and trying different fitness apps. However, I always felt like something was missing—most fitness apps focus only on one aspect, either workouts, nutrition, or tracking, but never all in one structured platform.</p>
            <p>That’s when I decided to develop the concept of FitLife Pro, an all-in-one fitness platform that brings together everything users need to stay consistent, track progress, and build healthier habits.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Concept Behind the App</h2>
            <p>FitLife Pro is a structured fitness application designed to make it easier for people to create and follow a complete training program. It includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Personalized Workout Plans– Users get tailored workouts based on their goals.</li>
                <li>Meal & Nutrition Tracking – A simple way to monitor food intake.</li>
                <li>Progress Tracking – A system to measure fitness improvements.</li>
                <li>Community Engagement – Motivation through challenges and group workouts.</l
